						<p>I dreamt of going to The University of Texas since I was young. 
						After graduating as valedictorian of my class at Rice High School in
						Altair, Texas, I achieved that dream as I began classes in 2013. I started
						my education as an undeclared student. After my first year, I found the
						glorious field of Computer Science and immediately transferred in. I came
						into the major with virtually no knowledge of the field, but caught on
						quickly in the fast-paced classes. In fact, I had never programmed before
						the first assignment in Intro to Java, and I am now creating things I never imagined.
						I am currently in Computer Organization and Architecture (CS 429), and plan on
						pursuing the INFOSEC certificate which focuses on cybersecurity and privacy.
						In addition to security, other areas of interest of mine include artificial 
						intelligence, mobile computing, and data mining. I expect to graduate in 
						May of 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.</p>

					<content>
						<p>I was born in Houston, Texas, but spent most of my life in
						the small town of Eagle Lake, Texas. When I am not working on some 
						sort of project, much of my free time is spent watching my favorite 
						sports teams: the Houston Astros, the Houston Texans, and the Houston 
						Rockets. In addition to that, I thoroughly enjoy listening to and 
						making music. </p>

						<p>In a short amount of time, I have accumulated many technical
						skills between different languages and software. I am proficient in
						Java and Python, and am intermediate with C, C++, Javascript, HTML,
						CSS, and x86 assembly language. As far as software goes, I am well-versed
						with Microsoft Office, and feel comfortable with Git, Emacs, LinuxOS
						and Eclipse.</p>

				<h2><span style="color: #BF5700">Huffman Coding Project</span></h2>
				<p>In this project, based on David Huffman's graduate project, I used a 
				Huffman Tree (which is based off of a Binary Search Tree) to compress 
				files (jpg, txt, bmp, etc) to much smaller sizes. The tree kept track of
				characters and their frequency and assigned a code for that number
				to optimize the compression. A decompression algorithm was also programmed
				to retrieve the original file after it has been compressed.</p>

				<h2><span style="color: #BF5700">Fantasy Mock Draft Project</span></h2>
				<p>In order to challenge myself, as well as entertain myself, I decided
				to make a mock drafter for fantasy sports. The program picks an optimized
				team based on past and future performance. If there is a large expected
				decline in performance, the program tends to shy away from that player.
				The program also gives the user option to pick draft slot, and enable
				a bias towards favorite players or teams.</p>

				<h2><span style="color: #BF5700">Evil Hangman Project</span></h2>
				<p>A twist on classical hangman, this project led to an "evil" game.
				After the user chooses a word length, a list of words from the dictionary
				with the same length is created. Each time the user guesses a letter, if
				possible, the program updates the list with only words that do not contain
				the guessed letter so it shows up as a wrong guess.</p>
